This project aims to predict the outcome of a league of legends match given it's in-game statistics like kills/deaths/assists (KDA), gold earned, vision score and creep score (CS).
All the recorded matches have been retrieved through [Porofessor](www.porofessor.gg) while respecting robots.txt. I personally really enjoy playing the champion [Leona](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/leona), so the dataset currently includes every ranked match during Season 3 2025 that I played support as Leona.
A simple neural network created in pytorch trained over 1000 epochs was used for this purpose
